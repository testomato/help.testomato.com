The simply answer is NO. If your application is protected from cross-site request forgery attacks, it's also preventing Testomato from sending requests with minicrawler, but we can try to bridge the simplest type of protection by doubling the request. During the first request, Testomato ignores HTTP response code - usually there’s some sort of unauthorized request response, but we update all hidden form params values and save the session.The second request is submitted within the same session in the hopes that one of the hidden params has a valid CSRF token What is CSRF protection​ Cross-site request forgeries are a type of malicious exploit where unauthorized commands are performed on behalf of an authenticated user. In case you're not familiar with cross-site request forgeries, let's discuss an example of how this vulnerability can be exploited. Imagine your application has a /user/email route that accepts aPOST request to change the authenticated user's email address. This route most likely expects an email input field to contain the email address the user would like to begin using. Without CSRF protection, a malicious website could create an HTML form that points to your application's /user/email route and submits the malicious user's own email address &lt;form action=&quot;https://your-application.com/user/email&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; value=&quot;malicious-email@example.com&quot;&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.forms[0].submit(); &lt;/script&gt; Preventing CSRF Requests​ You can generate a CSRF &quot;token&quot; for each active user session managed by the application. This token is used to verify that the authenticated user is the person actually making the requests to the application. Since this token is stored in the user's session and changes each time the session is regenerated, a malicious application is unable to access it. &lt;?php session_start(); if (empty($_SESSION['token'])) { $_SESSION['token'] = bin2hex(random_bytes(32)); } $token = $_SESSION['token']; ?&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;https://your-application.com/user/email&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; value=&quot;malicious-email@example.com&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;token&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo $token ?&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; Anytime you define an HTML form in your application, you should include a hidden CSRF _token field in the form so that the CSRF protection can validate the request. if (!empty($_POST['token'])) { if (hash_equals($_SESSION['token'], $_POST['token'])) { // Proceed to process the form data } else { // Log this as a warning and keep an eye on these attempts } } Per-Form Tokens​ You can go even further and generate Per-Form Tokens for every single form on your application: &lt;?php $second_token = hash_hmac('sha256', '/my_form.php', $_SESSION['second_token']); ?&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;token&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo $second_token ?&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;?php $calc = hash_hmac('sha256', '/my_form.php', $_SESSION['second_token']); if (hash_equals($calc, $_POST['token'])) { // Continue... } You can also change the name of the token variable or invalidate a token periodically in time. If you have a security requirement that each CSRF token is allowed to be usable exactly once, the simplest strategy is to regenerate it after each successful validation. However, doing so will invalidate every previous token, which can negatively impact the experience of users who browse multiple tabs simultaneously.

Why does Testomato say my site is down when it's not?​ Testomato may occasionally report your site as down or unavailable even when everything looks fine when you investigate yourself. There are a few reasons this can happen. Monitoring is done from an external location​ Testomato Bot tests your site from outside the local network where your server is hosted. This means it is subject to the same network conditions as any external visitor, including latency — the time it takes data to travel from one point to another. In some cases, a brief network disruption between Testomato's monitoring location and your server can make your site appear unreachable, even if it is functioning normally for users in other locations. Testomato retests before alerting​ To reduce false alerts caused by short-term issues, Testomato automatically retests your project a second time before sending a downtime notification. You will only receive an alert if the second test also fails. More monitoring locations​ Testomato is continuously adding monitoring locations to reduce the influence of any single connection on your results.

It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. When accessing a web server or application, every HTTP request that is received by a server is responded to with an HTTP status code. Status codes are three-digit numbers where the first digit indicates the class of response: 100–199 Informational responses200–299 Successful responses300–399 Redirects400–499 Client-side errors500–599 Server errors 200 OK​ The request has succeeded and all requested data was located on the server and transferred to the client. This code is rarely visible to end users. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method used, but this code always indicates a successful operation. 301 Moved Permanently​ The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, which is included in the response. The browser automatically redirects the user to the new address, and the old address is no longer valid. Like 200, this code typically goes unnoticed by users as the redirect happens automatically. 302 Found​ Officially called 302 Found, this code is commonly referred to as a temporary redirect. The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL. Unlike a 301, the original address remains valid and the redirect is not permanent. The browser follows the redirect automatically. 403 Forbidden​ The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. The client does not have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. 404 Not Found​ The server cannot find the requested resource. Links that lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links. See how Testomato uses 404 checks below. 500 Internal Server Error​ The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This is a generic catch-all error; more specific 5xx codes may be more appropriate in some cases. Users can generally assume the issue is being investigated and the server will be available again later. Why does Testomato check /thisShouldNotExist?​ Testomato automatically generates a 404 check for each new project to verify that your server correctly returns a 404 Not Found response for non-existent pages. This matters because some servers return a 200 OK response even for pages that don't exist — a pattern sometimes called a &quot;soft 404&quot; — which can harm your site's SEO. A well-configured 404 page also helps retain users who follow broken links, by offering helpful navigation options rather than a dead end. You can see an example of a good 404 page at testomato.com/404. Is Testomato a broken link checker?​ No. Testomato checks the HTTP status of URLs you have configured, but it does not crawl your website or examine HTML to proactively search for broken links. tip If you need a broken link checker, try the Broken Link Checker Chrome Extension.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Testomato payment methods","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/payment/payment","content":"Testomato payment methods Which payment methods are accepted?​ Testomato accepts automatic payments by credit/debit card or PayPal or manual payments by check, wire/bank transfer.

Annual billing​ When you are on annual billing, subscriptions are charged once for the balance of one full year, and will not be charged again until the year is over. Being on the annual billing cycle will give you a discount compared to monthly billing. Monthly billing​ When you are on monthly billing, subscriptions are charged on the same date each month, for as long as that subscription is active. You can cancel your account at any time, taking effect at the next payment date. What should I do if my bill payment fails?​ If your bill payment fails, you can try re-entering your credit card details under Your Profile &gt; Billing &amp; Payment &gt; Billing Information. Your card may have expired or the details may have changed, which can cause payments to fail. If you continue to have issues processing the payment, contact us at support@testomato.com.","keywords":"","version":"Next"}],"options":{"id":"default"}}
