## Where can I find my invoices?

All Testomato invoices can be downloaded under [Your Profile > Billing & Payment > Your Invoices](https://www.testomato.com/user/payments/invoices).

## Can you email me a copy of my invoice?

Yes. Testomato always sends a copy of each invoice to your registered email address. You can also add up to three additional email addresses to receive invoice copies.

Change your preferences at [Your Profile > Billing & Payment > Billing Information](https://www.testomato.com/user/payments/billing).

## My invoice is wrong. What should I do?

If you have any concerns about your invoice, contact us at support@testomato.com with the following details:

* Invoice number
* Your account ID or email address
* Reason for dispute

We will review your invoice and, if a correction is needed, reissue it and send you an updated copy.

## Why do some invoice URLs go to fakturoid.cz?

Testomato uses [Fakturoid](https://www.fakturoid.cz/), a well-known Czech invoicing service, to manage and issue invoices. Links to invoices may direct you to our Fakturoid account at:

```
https://app.fakturoid.cz/testomato1/
```

This is expected and the link is safe to follow.
