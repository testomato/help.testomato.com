## What is the difference between annual and monthly billing?

The difference between annual and monthly billing is the frequency at which your billing information will be charged.

### Annual billing

When you are on annual billing, subscriptions are charged once for the balance of one full year, and will not be charged again until the year is over. Being on the annual billing cycle will give you a discount compared to monthly billing.

### Monthly billing

When you are on monthly billing, subscriptions are charged on the same date each month, for as long as that subscription is active.

You can cancel your account at any time, taking effect at the next payment date.

## What should I do if my bill payment fails?

If your bill payment fails, you can try re-entering your credit card details under [Your Profile > Billing & Payment > Billing Information](https://www.testomato.com/user/payments/billing). Your card may have expired or the details may have changed, which can cause payments to fail.

If you continue to have issues processing the payment, contact us at support@testomato.com.
