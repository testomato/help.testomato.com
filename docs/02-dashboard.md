**Dashboard** is meant to help you get a basic overview of what's
going on in your projects in a quick way.

When you sign in to Testomato, we want you to be able to know if there
are problems the minute you see your dashboard. That's why boxes will
change color according to the status of each check.

## Check colors

There are only **4 possible colors** for check boxes:

1.  **Green**: This page passed all checks.
2.  **Red**: This page failed some checks.
3.  **Orange**: This page timed out.
4.  **Gray**: This page has not been configured yet, has been *turned
    off*, or the results are not available.

## Compact mode

There is another mode called _compact_, this mode is useful for long projects.
