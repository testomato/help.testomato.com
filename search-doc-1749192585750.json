It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. When accessing a web server or application, every HTTP request that is received by a server is responded to with an HTTP status code. Status codes come in the format of 3 digit numbers. The first digit marks the class of the status code: 100–199 Informational responses200–299 Successful responses300–399 Redirects400–499 Client-side errorsand 500–599 Server errors - indicate problems on the server side 200 OK​ The request has succeeded. All the requested data was located on the web server and transferred to the client. Internet users do not usually see this code. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method, but this code always announces a successful operation. 301 Moved Permanently​ The 301 code means that the data requested from the client cannot be found under the given address since it has been moved permanently. Since the current location of the requested content is delivered in the status report, the browser can request the new address straightaway. The user is then forwarded to the new address and the old address is no longer valid. The 301 code also goes unnoticed because the URL in the address bar simply changes. 302 Moved Temporarily​ Unlike the 301 code, which is a permanent redirection, the 302 informs the user that the requested data has temporarily been moved. With a 302 code the remaining information is specified so that an automatic redirection can take place. The old address remains valid. 403 Forbidden​ The HTTP status code 403 tells the client that the requested data is access-protected and that the request cannot be performed due to the client not having authority. An automatically generated HTML page will let the user know about the access problem. 404 Not Found​ The HTTP 404 Not Found client error response code indicates that the server can't find the requested resource. Links which lead to a 404 page are often calledbroken or dead links, and can be subject to link rot. 500 Internal Server Error​ The 500 status code, or Internal Server Error, means that server cannot process the request for an unknown reason. Sometimes this code will appear when more specific 5xx errors are more appropriate. Internet users can presume that an administrator is working on the problem and that the server will be available later on. Why Testomato checking /thisShouldNotExist page?​ A 404 page is an page that appears when you click on a link that is broken and is therefore no longer (or in fact, never was) available. Testomato is generate this check automatically for new Project and watch that your server response with correct 404 Not Found response code. Because some servers might response with 200 OK response codes even for non existing pages and that's harm SEO. Content and links on 404 pages are so important because they give users a way out of the error page. Instead of closing the window or navigating away from your site, the user is able to find helpful and potentially relevant resources on another page.

The simply answer is NO. If your application is protected from cross-site request forgery attacks, it's also preventing Testomato from sending requests with minicralwer, but we can try to bridge the simplest type of protection by doubling the request. During the first request, Testomato ignores HTTP response code - usually there’s some sort of unauthorized request response, but we update all hidden form params values and save the session.The second request is submitted within the same session in the hopes that one of the hidden params has a valid CSRF token What's CSRF protecion​ Cross-site request forgeries are a type of malicious exploit where unauthorized commands are performed on behalf of an authenticated user. In case you're not familiar with cross-site request forgeries, let's discuss an example of how this vulnerability can be exploited. Imagine your application has a /user/email route that accepts aPOST request to change the authenticated user's email address. Most likely, this route expects an email input field to contain the email address the user would like to begin using. Without CSRF protection, a malicious website could create an HTML form that points to your application's /user/email route and submits the malicious user's own email address &lt;form action=&quot;https://your-application.com/user/email&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; value=&quot;malicious-email@example.com&quot;&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.forms[0].submit(); &lt;/script&gt; Preventing CSRF Requests​ You can generate CSRF &quot;token&quot; for each active user session managed by the application. This token is used to verify that the authenticated user is the person actually making the requests to the application. Since this token is stored in the user's session and changes each time the session is regenerated, a malicious application is unable to access it. &lt;?php session_start(); if (empty($_SESSION['token'])) { $_SESSION['token'] = bin2hex(random_bytes(32)); } $token = $_SESSION['token']; ?&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;https://your-application.com/user/email&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; value=&quot;malicious-email@example.com&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;token&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo $token ?&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; Anytime you define an HTML form in your application, you should include a hidden CSRF _token field in the form so that the CSRF protection can validate the request. if (!empty($_POST['token'])) { if (hash_equals($_SESSION['token'], $_POST['token'])) { // Proceed to process the form data } else { // Log this as a warning and keep an eye on these attempts } } Per-Form Tokens​ You can go even further and generate Per-Form Tokens for every single form on your application: &lt;?php $second_token = hash_hmac('sha256', '/my_form.php', $_SESSION['second_token']); ?&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;token&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo $second_token ?&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;?php $calc = hash_hmac('sha256', '/my_form.php', $_SESSION['second_token']); if (hash_equals($calc, $_POST['token'])) { // Continue... } You can also change the name of the token variable or invalidate a token periodically in time. If you have a security requirement that each CSRF token is allowed to be usable exactly once, the simplest strategy is to regenerate it after each successful validation. However, doing so will invalidate every previous token which doesn't mix well with people who browse multiple tabs at once.
